# Command to start the FastAPI server using uvicorn.
# It runs the 'app' instance from the 'crossroad.api.main' module.
# '--host 0.0.0.0' makes it accessible from outside the container.
# '--port $PORT' uses the port provided by the deployment platform environment variable.
# '--workers 1' is a safe default, adjust if needed based on performance/platform guidance.
